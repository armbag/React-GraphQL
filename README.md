React Advanced Course by WesBos

This course was first developed by using Next.js and apolloClient for the front, and graphql yoga with prisma (v1) for the backend.
I updated the backend by replacing yoga with apolloServer (v2) as yoga is no longer maintained.

Testing is done with jest and enzyme.
